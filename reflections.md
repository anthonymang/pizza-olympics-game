1. On Monday and Tuesday, I finished a very basic playable version of my game. Both players can compete and a winner is determined
2. My goal today is to make the game look enjoyable to play. That is going to come from styling the text, reorganizing/styling the buttons by putting icons in their place, adjusting my grid, and making a pizza show up on command to match the ingredients selected by the user 
3. Had trouble getting the play again button to work.
